## Carry Strategy Implementation

This repository provides a simple implementation of a long/short portfolio, utilizing cross sectional daily funding rates from Binance perps  data. The strategy ranks assets by decile based on their funding rates, transforms these rankings into an alpha signal, and maps them to target exposures using a sigmoid function.
